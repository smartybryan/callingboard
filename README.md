# CallingBoard

CallingBoard is a tool to assist ward Bishopric 
with the task of reorganization.

It provides a user interface for leadership
to model a collection of calling releases and
sustainings and provides a printed report.

Data is imported from reports available in
LCR on ChurchOfJesusChrist.org. The Import tab
within the app has links and instructions.

on port 443 unless port 80 is explicitly requested.
