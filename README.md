# CALLORG

This project is the beginnings of a tool to
assist Ward Bishopric with re-organizing their ward.

It will be a way to model proposed changes
and track releasings and sustainings.

TODO
- Box on left to drag a calling to for a release
- Member box on left to drag a person from for a calling
- Style calling box same as the callings in the tree
- Search box for members ?
- Authentication/authorization ?

WORKFLOW
- Release and Sustain box
- Drag a calling into Release to release the member (make the calling vacant)
- Drag a member (from the member box) to a calling in the tree and it adds them to the Sustain box
- Delete a row from either box to back out the change.
