# CallingBoard

CallingBoard is a tool to assist ward Bishopric 
with the task of reorganization.

It provides a user interface for leadership
to model a collection of calling releases and
sustainings and provides a printed report.

Data is imported from reports available in
LCR on ChurchOfJesusChrist.org.

When run, the program provides an HTTP interface 
on port 40630.

TODO
- Handle orphaned transactions.
- Change tree filters to radio buttons.
- Change name of project to wardboard
- HTTPS
- Convert UI to Flexbox
- Authentication/authorization (for multi-tenant only?)
