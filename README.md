# CALLORG

This project is the beginnings of a tool to
assist Ward Bishopric with re-organizing their ward.

It will be a way to model proposed changes
and track releasings and sustainings.

TODO

- Move a person from one calling to another.
- Add a person to a calling and remove them from the available list if there.
- Remove person from a calling. If they have no other callings, add them to an available list.
- Build a diff summary between the base model and the proposed model.
