		<br><br>
		<div class="sub-heading">Overview</div>
		<div class="help-paragraph">
			Callingboard.org is a tool that models releases and sustainings
			during ward reorganizations.
			It is designed to be similar to a physical calling board where you move magnets
			labeled with member's names around on the board to simulate calling changes.
			It helps you visualize the "ripple affect" that can occur
			during this process so you know who still needs a calling and which callings
			need to be filled.
			<br><br>
			At least one person in your unit will be responsible for importing data from
			Leader and Clerk Resources (LCR)
			on ChurchOfJesusChrist.org so you will always be working with the latest information
			available. Once you have this data, you may begin to model calling changes. Once
			you have completed modeling, the Print Report page contains a summary of your
			changes so the ward membership clerk can enter them into LCR.
			There is no way provided by the church to directly import data or make changes
			to LCR data outside of the church website, so some manual processes are required.
		</div>

		<div class="sub-heading">Login</div>
		<div class="help-paragraph">
			Logging in to Callingboard.org is not for security, but rather so everyone in your unit
			can share information. There is no registration process, so the username you choose is arbitrary.
			The unit number is also arbitrary, but you must use the same value as others in your
			unit so you can share the imported data and saved models.
			<br><br>
			If you are concerned about other users of Callingboard.org seeing your unit's member names and
			calling data, you may use a secret value as your unit number, much like a shared password,
			which is known only to your unit.
			<br><br>
			Callingboard.org only exposes a members preferred name and calling information.
			If you are concerned about this level of information potentially being exposed by a
			dishonorable person, then the current version of Callingboard.org
			may be installed on your own server. (See https://github.com/smartybryan/callingboard).
			If there is sufficient demand, proper authentication may be added to callingboard.org in the future.
		</div>

		<div class="sub-heading">Importing Data</div>
		<div class="help-paragraph">
			At least one person in your unit must import the data from ChurchOfJesusChrist.org.
			Select the <strong>Import</strong> tab, then follow the instructions to
			import the member data, then import the calling data.
			Repeat this process to refresh the data when changes have been made using LCR.
			<br><br>
			<strong>Tip:</strong> When importing Members information you must scroll all the way to the bottom of the page.
			This assures that your browser has downloaded all available member information.
			When you attempt to select the page, if your browser does not appear to select anything,
			click on an empty spot on the page then try selecting it again.

		<div class="sub-heading">Modeling</div>
		<div class="help-paragraph">
			Modeling is the process of building a list of releases and sustainings.
		</div>

		<div class="sub-sub-heading">Members</div>
		<div class="sub-help-paragraph">
			The Members column allows you to search for and list members. To find a member
			quickly, start typing in the Filter box.
			Click on a member name to list all of their callings under <strong>Member Callings</strong>
			at the bottom of the column.
			<br><br>
			To assign a member to a calling, drag their name into a vacant calling in the <strong>Calling Board</strong>.
			(See Sustainings)
			<br>
			To release a member from one of their callings, you can drag the calling from <strong>Member Callngs</strong> into
			the <strong>Releases</strong> column. (See Releases)
			<br><br>
			To list members using the various categories represented as buttons at the bottom of the list,
			simply click the button. Some of the most helpful buttons are:
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Newly Available:</strong> This lists members who have been released in this model
					and who may need a calling. Note that if a newly released member has multiple callings
					and they were not released from all of them, they will not be in this list.
				</li>
				<br>
				<li><strong>Focus Members:</strong> This lists members who have been setup in the Focus Members
					tab. These are members who have your focus as they could use a calling.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div class="sub-sub-heading">Releases</div>
		<div class="sub-help-paragraph">
			To release a member from a calling, you need to expand the <strong>Calling Board</strong> tree
			on the right side of the screen and locate the appropriate member/calling card.
			You then drag that calling to the <strong>Releases</strong> column
			until you see a "+" sign, then release the mouse button. You will see the
			calling appear in that column and will also see that the calling is Vacant
			in the Calling Board on the right. An alternative method is to click on a member name
			in the <strong>Members</strong> list which lists all of their current callings, then
			drag one of those callings into the <strong>Releases</strong> list.
			<br><br>
			To immediately undo the last release, click the Undo button at the bottom of the page.
			To remove any calling under Releases, you may drag the calling into the trash can.
			Once you do either of these actions, you will see that the calling has been
			restored in the Calling Board and that it no longer appears in the Releases column.
		</div>

		<div class="sub-sub-heading">Sustainings</div>
		<div class="sub-help-paragraph">
			To assign a member to a calling, locate their name in the <strong>Members</strong> column on the left.
			You can begin typing in the Filter box to quickly find their name.
			Now simply drag their name onto a vacant calling on the <strong>Calling Board</strong>.
			You will see the calling appear in the <strong>Sustainings</strong> column and will also see that
			they have been assigned to that calling in the <strong>Calling Board</strong>.
			<br><br>
			To immediately undo the latest sustaining, click the Undo button at the bottom of the page.
			To undo any calling under Sustainings, you may drag the calling into the trash can.
			Once you do either of these actions, you will see that the calling has been
			made vacant in the Calling Board and it no longer appears in the Sustainings column.
		</div>

		<div class="sub-sub-heading">Calling Board</div>
		<div class="sub-help-paragraph">
			This lists all callings for your unit as defined in LCR and have been imported.
			You may navigate this tree by expanding and collapsing organizations,
			or click the <strong>Expand All</strong> and <strong>Collapse All</strong> buttons.
			<br><br>
			To list all vacant callings which includes all callings flagged as vacant in LCR,
			click the <strong>All Vacant</strong> button.
			You may also show only callings that were made vacant in this model as a result of Releases,
			by clicking the <strong>New Vacant</strong> radio button.
			<br><br>
			To release a member from a calling, you may drag any filled calling into the
			Releases column. (See Releases)
		</div>

		<div class="sub-heading">Print Report</div>
		<div class="help-paragraph">
			This tab shows a printable summary report of the Releases and Sustainings
			in this model. This report may be helpful to those conducting and for the ward membership
			clerk to enter this information into LCR. The Print button sends the report to a printer.
		</div>

		<div class="sub-heading">Model Management</div>
		<div class="help-paragraph">
			This tab allows you to manage models (releasings and sustainings) that can be viewed
			by other users in your unit. The available actions are:
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Save Model:</strong> Save the current model as the name in the field.</li>
				<li><strong>Refresh List:</strong> Refresh the list of models available to your unit.</li>
				<li><strong>Load Model:</strong> Load the selected model and overwrite any unsaved changes to
					the current model in the Modeling tab.</li>
				<li><strong>Merge Model:</strong> Load the selected model and merge it with the current model
					in the Modeling tab. This allows multiple people to work on parts of a model, then
					merge them all into a single model.</li>
				<li><strong>Delete Model:</strong> Deletes the highlighted model in the list.</li>
				<li><strong>Reset Model:</strong> Clears the current model in the Modeling tab.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div class="sub-heading">Focus Members</div>
		<div class="help-paragraph">
			This tab allows you to build a list of members you wish to focus on with regard to callings.
			The members you select in this tab will be listed in the <strong>Modeling</strong> tab
			when you click the <strong>Focus Members</strong> button in the <strong>Members</strong> column.
